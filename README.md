# Smarter Sorting Coding Challenge
 
 Note: I spoke with Kevin Cashman about some issues I had with the project, but I felt that I should note them here, I created this originally without using a database or a UI software because I didn't realize that was a requirement and ran into too many issues attempting to set-up/use these. I feel like with some guidance I'd be able to, but for sake of showing of effort and not spending an additional 10 hours on top of the 14 I spent learning flask and html since I had not worked with them in my previous internships or coursework, Kevin requested I send this instead. Thank you for your understanding.

(As this is my first time working with this type of development, I hope these steps are sufficient)
 1. Insure Python 3 and Flask are installed on you machine
 2. Using a command terminal, navigate to the hello_flask folder
 3. Run ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1" to activate the virtual environment
 4. Run "python -m flask run" to run the application
 5. Navigate to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" or "localhost:5000"
